This code simulates a car picking up and dropping off passengers, 
using pthreads and semaphores for coordination. Here's a simpler and briefer explanation:

# Initialization:
        The program starts by getting the total number of passengers and the car's capacity.
        It uses semaphores to control access to critical sections.

# Car Functions:
        load simulates passengers getting on the car.
        passing simulates the car moving.
        unload simulates passengers getting off.

# Car Thread:
        The car runs in a loop, controlling loading, moving, and unloading.
        Semaphores ensure proper synchronization during these phases.

# Passenger Functions:
        board simulates a passenger getting on.
        offboard simulates a passenger getting off.

# Passenger Thread:
        Each passenger runs in a loop, boarding and getting off as allowed.

# Concurrency Bug Avoidance:
        Semaphores control access to critical sections.
        Flags (boardingAllowed and deBoardingAllowed) signal the car's state.
        Synchronization ensures a coordinated sequence of actions.

In summary, the code uses semaphores and flags to coordinate the car and passengers, preventing concurrency issues. It simulates passengers boarding, the car moving, and passengers getting off in a controlled manner.
